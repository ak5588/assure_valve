              Assure Valve Component Manufacturing Co. is a Vadodara-based precision manufacturer specialising in
              CNC turning, VMC machining and specialist welding for valve, turbine and heavy-engineering
              applications. Since 2005, we have supplied dimensionally critical components to OEMs across India
              and abroad.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our shop floor combines Jyoti CNC turning centres, VMC machines and certified welding capabilities
              with a calibrated inspection lab — allowing us to move from bar stock to finished, inspected
              components entirely in-house.
            </p>
            <p>
              We serve procurement teams who value repeatability, documentation and on-time delivery over
              lowest-cost promises. That focus has earned us long-term relationships with vendor-approved
              suppliers to global industrial names.
